# Berkeley Ecoinformatics Search Engine

In this project, Stamen is designing two main methods of searching the Berkeley Ecoinformatics database, one method primarily based on a map and another on time or other non-geographical elements. To the greatest extent possible, code should be modular so that elements like timelines or selectors can be recombined in furute work after our engagement is complete.

## Branches

* List, describe and link

To clone a specific branch (to prevent having to switch branches when working
on different components), use:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:stamen/berkeley-ecoinformatics.git -b <branch> repo-name-<branch>
```

## Dependencies

### Software

This is a front-end-development project only, but we'll probably have dependencies like D3 and Leaflet and maybe others as well.

### Data

* All data will come from the Berkeley Ecoinformatics API, documented at https://dev-ecoengine.berkeley.edu/docs/quickstart.html
* No other data will be part of the project
* During development, use the dev site at https://dev-ecoengine.berkeley.edu/

### Static Assets

* Location and (basic) description of images, existing CSS, HTML, etc.

## How do I install it?

Describe that here.

## How do I test it other than locally?

Do we have Prosthetic or any other special methods required for testing? Describe those here if so.

## How do I deploy it to the world?

If this is a live thing in the world, how do we push changes to the live thing?
