Adding Checklist
ECO is a global variable in explore tool. The query string is stashed here in the following line:
ECO.speciescheckliststring = ECO.endpoints.observations + "?fields=kingdom,phylum,order,clss,family,genus,scientific_name" + orderString + facetstring + qString + bboxString + dateString + "&page_size=" + queryObj.page_size + pageString;
d3 is used to handle the event:
	d3.select("#export-checklist").on("click", function() { ECO.checkList(ECO.speciescheckliststring) } );
ECO.checklist sends the query (ECO.speciescheckliststring) off to BEE API, modifies it, and responds with a CSV.
